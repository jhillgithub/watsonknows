# Watson Judges You

##Description A Singlr-Page App integrating React/Redux, IBM Watson, Recharts, and Material-Ui, in order to judge you and your sentences.

##Motivation I wanted to integrate these components together with data analytics(and a little AI) as my final personal project for class. The color scheme ended up being a nod to my favorite color scheme (Monokai) while editing code. 


##Results For the most part, it came out as planned. 

### Shout out to Jeremy for the help and inspiration

##ImprovementsConverting the totalMood to an overall percentage, instead of just a cumulative score of all the inputs. See about assigning the colors instead of just looping them through an array. Integrating the language category (analytical, confident, and tentative).
